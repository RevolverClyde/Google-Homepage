First project, wow! What a test of my knowledge and ability to research. 

What did I learn?

1. Projects are hands down the best way to learn. 
2. Watching Tutorials will help you, if you are a visual learner like me. 
3. There is always more than one way to do something.
4. Inspecting site data for specifics is crucial to making something look accurate.
5. Workflow: Get your HTML done first. After that,then do your CSS. 
6. I am going to have to do this everyday. 

On HTML

This project really forced me to understand HTML tags as well as 'id' and 'class' particulars. 

Before hand I really did not get what <div> and <a> meant, and now I fully understand them.

On CSS

CSS is incredibly powerful, and even more so with the usage of grid and flexbox.
